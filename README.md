# Odin Recipes

This is a simple recipe website created using only HTML and CSS
as part of the Foundations Course from the Odin Project.
By building this website, I was able to practice some of the HTML
and CSS knowledge that I gained from the course so far,
including but not limited to:
* HTML boilerplate
* basic structure of an HTML file
* common HTML elements and how to use them
* semantic HTML
* CSS selectors
* grouping selectors
* basic CSS properties and values
* the Box Model

A few other lessons that I learned:
* The optimal image resolution for the web is 72 DPI.
* Certain HTML elements have default margins and paddings that need to
  be accounted for during layout.
* The Chrome DevTools (or any browser's developer tools for that matter)
  is useful for debugging CSS issues.
