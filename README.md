# Odin Recipes

This is a simple recipe website built entirely using HTML.
It is the culmination of the HTML Foundations course from the Odin Project.
By building this website, I was able to practice all the HTML knowledge
that I gained from the course, including but not limited to:
* HTML boilerplate
* basic structure of an HTML file
* common HTML elements and how to use them
* semantic HTML

In addition to HTML knowledge, I learned that the optimal resolution for images
for the web is 72 DPI when I was trying to get the images of the recipes
to look good on the web pages.
